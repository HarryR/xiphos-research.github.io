        <h4>Application Security Testing</h4>
<p>The security (or otherwise) of enterprise applications has become an increasing concern over the last decade. Ensuring the
        security posture of external facing and internal applications has become a significant business focus. Many organisations claim
        to be able to deliver focused, outsourced assessment services, however Xiphos Research are unique in as much as traditionally
        the security assessment of web application and services security has been one of our core business areas of focus and expertise.</p>
        
        <p>Xiphos Research provides our clients with a proven methodology that is backed up by industry recognised expertise coupled with
        a passionate and innovative approach to application and services security. Xiphos employ an approach that is focused on ensuring
        that not only are our clients protected from a range of current attack vectors, but can also continue to guard themselves against
        emerging digital threats.</p>
        
        <p>Our project approach is attuned individually to suit the unique needs and criteria of our clients. It can be loosely defined
        as following an assessment cycle that consists of the following distinct stages:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Information Gathering and Enumeration</li>
          <li>Vulnerability Identification</li>
          <li>Attack, Exploitation and Penetration</li>
          <li>Privilege Escalation</li>
          <li>Reporting and Documentation</li>
          <li>Clean up and Debriefing</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Each stage of the application security assessment process is conducted in the strictest confidence and with client confidentiality
        and safety our highest priority. As well as conducting assessment activities, it is the assertion of Xiphos Research, that results
        are meaningless unless they are contextual to the needs and requirements of our clients. As part of the reporting cycle we prioritise
        discovered vulnerabilities and analyse and verify the results. As part of the reporting cycle, Xiphos Research provide our clients
        with vulnerability descriptions that can be understood by all levels of personnel within client organisations but also contain
        mitigation strategies that easily allow vulnerabilities to be addressed in a timely and secure manner.</p>
        
        <p>The application security assessment services provided by some companies consist of nothing more that scanning client services and
        applications with 'off the shelf' software. This is an approach that XRL are fundamentally opposed to. Although automated security
        applications provide a broad overview of the security of applications and services, they lack the depth that can only be provided by
        manual testing undertaken by experts. The security assessment activities undertaken by XRL are specifically designed to mirror the
        attacks and methodologies that would be employed by a knowledgeable and skilled remote attacker, and ensure that our clients are
        protected against people, and not just software. </p>

        <h4>Internal Infrastructure Security Testing</h4>
            <p>Typically penetration testing activities focus upon familiar assets (e.g. the external facing IP addresses associated with a
        client organisations, the DMZ, the firewall instances, etc.) however, XRL strongly believe that this approach fails to provide
        risk assurance and may be allowing organisations to falsely believe their security posture is greater than it in actuality is.
        Perimeter protections have becoming increasingly resilient, but internal defences are often still a pronounced security risk.</p>
        
        <p>A number of our competitors offer some client side penetration services, typically however such actions are limited in scope
        to spear-phishing activities, whereby they seek to manipulate legitimate users via email. Xiphos Research believes that the range
        of 'testing' should extend beyond sending a few emails however.</p>
        
        <p>The client side security assessment activities offered by XRL include a range of test vectors. In addition to the manipulation
        of client personnel via malicious emails / distribution of links, Xiphos Research are adept at the creation of targeted malware,
        and social engineering and data collection activities. In addition to testing the endpoint security of client systems and the
        identification of linked sensitive systems, we can also test the efficacy of protection mechanisms (such as AV and mail gateways)
        that may be in place. Not only do the client side security assessment services that we offer by identify vulnerabilities within
        endpoint client security and processes, but also within protection mechanisms and linked sensitive systems. In addition to purely
        technical attacks, we can at client request engage in focused social engineering attacks encompassing physical intrusion and
        telecommunications manipulation / interception.</p>

	  				To that end, Xiphos offer continuous penetration testing to our clients. For a fixed fee, Xiphos offer a mechanism where internal and external testing can be performed on an ad-hoc and as needed basis. This allows our clients to rapidly identify critical vulnerabilities that exist within their technology stacks without the delays that may be caused by traditional penetration testing cycles. </p>

					<p>By utilising a secure, proven, and bespoke remote access solution, Xiphos can test both internal and external assets on a pre-agreed cycle, or an ad-hoc basis to fully emulate the actions of a dedicated attacker who has gained access to an estate. </p>
